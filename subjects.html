            <h3 class="lg-4">Standard Level & High Level:</h3>
						<p style="text-align:justify;">French language and literature is a compulsory subject, in which students must choose between SL and HL. In this subject, the main difference between both levels, is that HL students study 6 works, each of them in different forms of literary texts, times and places instead of 4 works. The official assessment compromises two papers: the first one is an analysis of a literary and non-literary text not studied before in class, and the second one is a comparative answer to a question focused on two literary works already studied by the student. In addition, HL students will be assessed by paper 3 which consists of 1200-1500 word essay about one piece studied during class. </p>
            <h3 class="lg-4">Internal Assesment:</h3>
            <p  style="margin-bottom: -50px;" style="text-align:justify;">The Internal Assesment(IA) consists of an individual oral presentation about 3 works, chosed by the student. The presentation has to last between 10 and 15 minutes and contributes to a 15% of the final grade.</p>					</div>

						<p style="text-align:justify;">English B aims to enable the students to communicate in English in both familiar and unfamiliar environments. The first paper of the assessment consists of a writing from a choice of 3 related to the topics studied by the students all over the 2 years, which are:
            </p>
              <ol>

              </ol> 
            <p style="text-align:justify;">Paper 2 involves two sections of reading and listening. Both levels are assessed equally, however, in HL they will require more complex language and structures, as well as an extended word range.</p>

						<p style="text-align:justify;">In the IB DP is compulsury to take Mathematics classes and will be assessed in French. School offeres 3 types of Mathematics courses:

              <ul>
                <li>Apllication SL</li>

              <li>Calculus</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">In addition the students will have to study one option out of four, which is in this case: Further statistics and probability. </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">The main difference between application and analysis is the number of hours spend learning about each unit. For example, application students, are most likely to spend more time learning about statistics and probability, and on the other hand, analysis students will learn more about geometry and trigonometry.</p>
